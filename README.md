# Task-5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided train.csv (Titanic) dataset.

Inspected the dataset's basic information, statistics, and value distributions. Then, created a series of visualizations—including a heatmap, pairplot, histograms, boxplots, and countplots—to uncover relationships and trends within the data. Through this analysis, determined that the key factors influencing a passenger's survival were their sex, passenger class, and the fare they paid.
